# Spring Boot MongoDB
This document presents a minor case study that examines the utilisation of MongoDB alongside Spring Boot. We will initially delineate the primary distinctions between the document-oriented paradigm, as exemplified by Banco de B, and the relational paradigm. The study will cover the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB, while also reflecting on the critical design decisions pertinent to a document-oriented database. Furthermore, we will explore how these operations would be conducted from a traditional relational perspective and investigate the methods for aggregating data into documents. A thorough analysis of these differences will be conducted in this section.
